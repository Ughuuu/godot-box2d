Go to any action workflow on this project: [Actions List](https://github.com/rburing/physics_server_box2d/actions)

1. [Download latest release](https://github.com/godot-box2d/godot-box2d/releases/latest) from github job
2. Extract the ZIP archive and move the `addons/` folder it contains into your project folder
3. Open your project settings
4. Make sure "Advanced Settings" is enabled
5. Go to "Physics" and then "2D"
6. Change "Physics Engine" to "Box2D"
7. Restart Godot

## Building from source

1. Clone the git repository, including its `box2d` and `godot-cpp` submodules.

2. Open a terminal application and change its working directory to the `godot-box2d` git repository.

3. Compile `godot-cpp` for the desired `target` (`template_debug` or `template_release`):

       cd godot-cpp
       scons target=template_debug generate_bindings=yes

4. Hack to disable b2Assert. Run:

On linux:

```
sed -i 's/#define b2Assert(A) assert(A)/#define b2Assert(A) ((void)(A))/g' ./box2d/include/box2d/b2_common.h
```

On macos:

```
sed -i '' 's/#define b2Assert(A) assert(A)/#define b2Assert(A) ((void)(A))/g' ./box2d/include/box2d/b2_common.h
```

5. Compile the GDExtension for the same `target` as above:

       cd ..
       scons target=template_debug generate_bindings=no

*Note*: The `template_debug` target can also be loaded in the Godot editor.

## Lint

Run `scripts/clang-tidy.sh` in order to lint.
