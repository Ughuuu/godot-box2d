[![ðŸ”— Build Status](https://github.com/appsinacup/godot-box2d/actions/workflows/runner.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/godot-box2d/godot-box2d/actions/workflows/runner.yml)

A [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) physics server for [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), implemented as a GDExtension.

# Installation

- Automatic (Recommended): Download the plugin from the official [Godot Asset Store](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2007) using the `AssetLib` tab in Godot.
- Manual: Download the source code and move only the addons folder into your project addons folder.

After installing, go to `Advanced Settings` -> `Physics` -> `2D`. Change `Physics Engine` to `Box2D`.

# Features

- Improved physics stability in some cases with high number of rigidbodies.

- Improves polygon collision by fixing [ghost collision](https://box2d.org/posts/2020/06/ghost-collisions/).

- Improves joints by [predictive joint limits](https://box2d.org/posts/2020/04/predictive-joint-limits/).

- Box2D is binary deterministic. Godot Box2D should also be binary deterministic, however no such tests were run yet.


# Limitations

- Having non symetrical physics mask/layers results in collision on both bodies.
- Circles and capsules only support uniform scaling and don't support skewing.
- Mass works as density instead of total mass.

# Roadmap

- Cross Platform Determinism
- Add more types of joints
- Pass all Godot Physics Tests.
